## How It Works

Right-click any HTTP request (or use the `...` menu) and select **Generate Code Snippet**.
A dialog lets you pick a language and library, with a live preview of the generated code.
Click **Copy to Clipboard** to copy the snippet. Your language and library selections are
remembered for next time.
